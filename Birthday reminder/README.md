## 🛠️ Description

Are you tired of forgetting about your family member´s birthdays and namedays? Are you the type of person who is buying presents last minute? Well, then you are same as me which means that this Birthday reminder might be the solution to your problems!

This code sends you an email reminder whenever a person from your database is approaching. At first, it will notify you 7 days prior to give you some time to order a present or two. Then it also reminds you to send your dear person a message on their special day!

For security purposes I implemented TLS and used all emails and passwords as environmental variables stored in a .env file.

## ⚙️ Languages or Frameworks Used

To make this work you need to make sure to have python and pandas module installed on your PC. I decided to use this module to get some practical experience with its data manipulation but feel free to use a different approach of your liking.

I used pip to install this module:

## 🌟 How to run

To make this code efficient, you need to find a way how to run this code every day. While creating this code I was thinking about two possibilities. Running the code on startup on my PC (I am on PC almost every day) or setting up a task manager that will be more reliable.

I uploaded the code to pythonanywhere.com and I am running it as scheduled task from there. Although, it is limited to only one task per free account (which is enough if you want to run this code in particular).
